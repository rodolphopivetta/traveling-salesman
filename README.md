# Traveling Salesman solved by Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains a implementation of two algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman problem:

* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm

This work compares the implementations, so the ```tsp.py``` file executes the random generation of cities and uses this collection to send to the algorithms.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you need to install the matplotlib.

``` sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib ```

## Execution

To execute, just call

``` python tsp.py ```

This will show three graphs, first with the initial and final tours to Simulated Annealing and the second for Genetic Algoritm. The third graph shows the comparision of the executions.

-------

This repository have too a report (in Brazilian Portuguese) of this implementations and the results of observations.
